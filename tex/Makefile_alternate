# This Makefile uses the program "rubber" to 
# implement Latex dependencies instead of GNU Make:
# http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/ 
# You can download and install this program to use
# this Makefile, which is functionally equivalent
# to Makefile.  Or, just use "rubber" at the 
# command line to create your files.  The 
# advantage to "Makefile" is that interdependencies 
# between Latex source files (*.tex files) are handled
# automatically.  Of course, both this and Makefile
# are completely optional as far as the dissertation
# template is concerned.  You are free to just use
# Latex manually.
