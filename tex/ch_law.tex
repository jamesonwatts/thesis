Marketing is operating in interesting and challenging times. Of course one could argue this has always been the case; however, with the expansion of global competition, accelerating sustainability concerns and an increased focus on innovation, marketing and marketers are likely to confront an escalating set of challenges. \citet[p. 1]{reibstein2009} sum it up well when they observe that marketing executives operate in an ``ambiguous, uncertain, fast-changing, and complex marketplace"--a statement echoed by a growing chorus of marketing scholars \citep[see e.g.][]{achrol1999, achrol2012, webster1992}. My goal is to help make sense of these complex marketplaces through a deeper understanding of marketing as exchange.

The contribution of this chapter is conceptual in nature. I am providing a novel way in which to ``envision" both markets and marketing \citep{macInnis2011}. To do so, we must delay the inclination to focus on matters of marketing management or public policy. If we rush too quickly towards normative theory, we are vulnerable to a fragmentation of thought more severe than Levitt (1960) discussed in his seminal article on marketing myopia. Indeed, we become \emph{market myopic} and fail to discover the generalities that apply to exchange in most (if not all) markets. I begin by reviewing the notion of exchange as the primary focus of marketing.\footnote{This chapter is based on a paper written for the marketing theory seminar taught by Robert F. Lusch in 2010. We have jointly developed the theory and writing in the years since.}

\section{Exchange as the Focus of Marketing}
In 1965, Wroe Alderson laid the foundation for exchange as the focus of marketing with the ``law of exchange"  \citep{alderson1965a}--a contribution that stimulated substantial interest in a broader view of marketing \citep{kotler1969, kotler1972}.  Soon thereafter, a consensus emerged that the exchange concept was crucial to any complete understanding of marketing as a science \citep{bagozzi1974, bagozzi1975, houston1987}. This was a bold departure from 1930's thinking, when prominent organizations like the National Association of Marketing Teachers (NAMT) and the subsequent American Marketing Association (AMA) defined marketing as ``business activities involved in the flow of goods and services from production to consumption'' \citep{ama1937, lusch2007a}. 

In 1985 the AMA adopted a revised definition of marketing that included the exchange of goods and services, but also ideas. Originally, the notion of idea exchange was focused on the marketing of social causes and the emerging development of social marketing \citep{kotler1971}. however, I consider ``ideas" and their ``distribution" in a less restrictive context. In fact I argue that the exchange of all market offerings through voluntary exchange requires the presence of shared ideas. Ideas--what I later refer to as an actor's set of representations--are more than just \emph{elements of exchange}. Rather it is the similarity/dissimilarity of these ideas (representations) in a population that facilitates the \emph{process of exchange} itself. 

Although the broadening of marketing had been discussed for nearly two decades \citep{kotler1969} the revised AMA definition of marketing made the broadening of marketing official, and legitimized what \citep[p. 39]{bagozzi1974} had observed a decade earlier,  ``...marketing is a general function of universal applicability. It is the discipline of exchange behavior, and it deals with problems related to this behavior." Bagozzi further speculated that the exchange concept could serve as the basis of ``the elusive `general theory of marketing.'" I do not propose a general theory of marketing here. However, I am able to show how an extended ``law of exchange" can be used to generate propositions that move us closer to a \emph{generalizable} understanding of markets and marketing. 

While largely skirting the issue of a general theory, there have been several notable attempts to embellish and amplify Alderson's law of exchange \citep{bagozzi1978, blalock1979, kotler1984, houston1987}. In one extension, \citet{vargo2004,  vargo2008} argue that service for service exchange is a more fundamental process than exchange of physical goods--a line of reasoning, which follows (and extends) that of \citet{bastiat1848}. Service is defined as the application of resources (primarily knowledge and skills) for the benefit of another actor \citep{vargo2004}. Hence all actors reciprocally exchange specialized knowledge and skills; or more simply, all actors do work for one another. When this exchange occurs through a tangible good, the good is an appliance that facilitates the distribution of a service \citep{vargo2004, vargo2008}. When this exchange occurs via a medium of exchange such as money, the money is simply a placeholder to subsequently exchange for service. Most importantly, this work lays the theoretical foundation for reclaiming the exchange concept from the producer-consumer distinction that has dominated mainstream theory for the last century \citep{vargo2011}. Indeed, Alderson's (1965) law of exchange and the seminal work of \citet{bagozzi1974, bagozzi1975} makes no such distinction between one actor being a producer or seller, and the other being a consumer or buyer. 

Despite the promise of the exchange concept (and Alderson's proposed law), there are still major gaps in our understanding of the nature and process of exchange. For instance, there is a great deal of disagreement about the conditions under which exchange is more or less likely \citep{houston1987}. Because of this, it may be time to revisit Alderson's original proposition as part of a search for the deeper and broader understanding that was part of the exchange concept's initial promise. Assuming such an understanding is attainable, my claim is that it should be capable of transcending both time and context. For this to occur, my extension of Alderson's law of exchange will necessarily keep to a high level of abstraction. This begins with an abstract and abbreviated view of human exchange. 

\textbf{On Human Exchange}.
As humans began to specialize, their communities became more efficient; however, each individual also became more dependent on others in the process--those who specialized in one area, would rely on the specialized knowledge and skills of those in another area \citep{vargo2004, vargo2008, bastiat1848}. This process led to an economy (society) of service for service exchange \citep{vargo2004, vargo2008, lusch2014}. This in turn, required the codification of ideas into a cognitive model, which I call a representation, and the subsequent development and diffusion of shared representations in a population \citep{sperber1985}. 

For the sake of clarity, I refer to an actor's collection of ideas (or mental models) as the set of representations that an actor has about the world. To the extent that any mental model persists for a relatively stable period of time, this definition of a representation is consistent with those found in a variety of social science traditions \citep[see e.g.][]{bartlett1932}. In a more recent treatment, \citet{loasby1999} defines representations as those items within the brain, which facilitate action or decisions. I expand the Loasby definition slightly to include understanding as well. In other words, stimulus need not always lead to immediate action or decision; it may just be sensed, and stored in memory for use in future decisions \citep{denzau1994}. 

As \citet{whitehead1911} in the opening quote recognizes, the societal and individual benefits of specialization drive humans to continue developing means to economize on decision-making, information processing, and search \citep{loasby1999}. Humans accomplish this through the creation and diffusion of representations. Examples include ideologies, dominant logics, and paradigms \citep{denzau1994, sperber1985}. These representations (when shared by a community) coordinate the exchange of specialized knowledge and skills and their application for mutual advantage among human actors. 

As a practical matter, the distinction between types of representation is manifold; however, each type is also similar, but in a very general sense. Simply, all representations can be conceived of as relatively persistent collections of ideas maintained by human actors. Moreover, each actor's collection of ideas (representations) may be more or less similar to the collection of their neighbor's. I argue, that it is this rather basic principle--the similarity/dissimilarity of representations within a community of actors--that drives much of what we observe in the ambiguous, uncertain, fast-changing, and complex marketplace, and for that matter, in markets in general. My theory is thus one, which describes the homogeny of representation (i.e. the clustering of ideas or mental models) in a community of actors. This basic notion leads us logically towards positive predictions about the nature of markets, and towards normative prescriptions for marketing activity. The development of these ideas is presented in the subsequent sections.

\section{Theory Background}

How do market actors interface with their world or environment? \citet{daft1984} argue that managers are always unique in their interpretation of the environment. \citet{day1994} demonstrate that managers form mental models (representations) of competitive advantage that influence strategic action. \citet{fligstein1996} theorizes that actors strive to ``create and maintain stable worlds within and across firms that allow firms to survive." This is a process that allows ``actors to interpret the actions of others and a reflection of how the market is structured" and to develop and enforce ``rules of exchange."  \citet{rosa1999} argue that buyers and sellers jointly develop market representations that determine how the environment is subsequently viewed and enacted. \citet[p. 143]{kjellberg2007} suggest that ``markets are abstract entities and in order to speak of the market for a certain type of good, it is necessary to bridge temporal and spatial distances between individual exchanges and produce images of this market." Finally, \citet{lusch2014} depict markets as dynamic constructions that are continuously being cocreated by market actors. 

All of the scholars referenced above treat the market as interpreted rather than fixed and absolute. If markets do not exist absent some interpretation, then representation must be at the core of market constitution. Even if some objective `market' does exist, it is an actor's unique set of representations that direct its action in the (objective) market context \citep{north1990, loasby1999}. Regardless, the justification for market representation is in its usefulness; representations reduce the effort required to judge suitability in the use of things--in consumption \citep{whitehead1911}. Indeed, representations are the means by which actors rationalize consumption--they are the ``how" of economic rationality. This concept is illustrated in the following paragraphs using a simple, market-based example. 

My illustration could use any number of market offerings that have become pervasive or dominant in a community; however, here I use a ``chair." When I enter a restaurant, I know what to sit upon; in North America it is generally not a stool or the floor for instance. At the same time the restaurant manager or owner knew to have chairs available for restaurant customers. Once a representation is developed, the effort required to reproduce the concept is trivial. In my example, this efficiency is likely due to a sequence of chair-related sensing episodes (i.e. where learning has occurred), each of which adds to the robustness of the chair representation in memory. In time, one develops a quiver of such representations, which facilitate efficient interaction with the environment, economizing on the scarce resource of the mind. 

When a set of similar representations is held by a threshold number of actors in a community, that consistency of understanding is the precursor to social coordination. Indeed, this homogeny in representation is stable because it has value beyond that which can be realized by any single actor. This is because it constitutes a coordination utility that benefits the community as a whole. For instance, one's concept of chair is made more useful by virtue of the fact that others share a similar representation of the object. When patrons enter a North American restaurant, little thought is wasted on how best to position oneself to eat. Moreover, North American restaurant owners waste little thought on whether to provide chairs for their patrons. As \citet{humphreys2010} has observed, prior to the introduction of an innovation (technology), consumers do not have a ``cognitive schema for understanding it" or the ``social norms for using it." 

As shared representations arise in a community, they become resources for human actors. As such, they can be drawn upon to economize on cognitive effort (as discussed above). But what sort of cognitive effort do shared representations minimize? Generally, it is the sort of thinking necessary to reduce uncertainty about future outcomes. For instance, when I see the form of a chair, I have a certain degree of confidence (little uncertainty) that my full-weight will be supported should I choose to sit on it. One could argue that if an objective is known, then efficiencies that lead to uncertainty reduction in achieving the objective are the only type that matter \citep{loasby1999}. If a community of actors can standardize thinking (in the form of symbol, routine, custom or product), then they can accomplish this type of efficiency. 

Some representations can reach the stage where a community of actors shares them over a long period of time. These long-lived, shared representations can be thought of as institutions or even culture \citep{sperber1985}. Indeed, \citet{north1990} defines institutions as ``humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interactions."  These may include norms, routines, laws or customs. However, each is developed and maintained as a means to coordinate human interaction so as to conserve the scarce resource of the mind \citep{loasby1999}. 

Based on the preceding reasoning one can argue that markets are more than the intersection of supply and demand (or a place where buyers and sellers come together).  Rather, markets are constituted by the set of shared representations in a community of actors. Or, as \citet{humphreys2010} observes, ``for a market to be created, producers and consumers must come to certain shared understandings of what is being exchanged and why." This market definition precedes one constituted by the intersection of supply and demand. Before supply and demand can unite, the representations of market actors need to unite. For example, the supply and demand for chairs (or what may be thought of as a chair market) depends crucially on some consensus regarding the representation of a chair. \footnote{Although I do not elaborate here, this consensus is also dependent on the use context of the object or in this case the ``chair." For instance, a representation of a suitable chair is different for a fine dining restaurant than for fast food. Nonetheless, shared representations are a necessary precondition for the emergence of a market.} I illustrate this point in the next section by demonstrating how even the most basic form of market exchange requires a threshold of representational homogeny. 

\section{Extending the Law of Exchange}
I draw upon the prior theoretical discussion to extend the \citet[p. 84]{alderson1965a} ``law of exchange." It should be noted that Alderson deals with restricted exchange, which is dyadic or reciprocal, however, there are more complex types of exchange such as generalized exchange and complex exchange, both of which involve at least three actors \citep{bagozzi1975}. For the current discussion I focus on restricted exchange, as did Alderson.  In his law, the dyadic transfer of elements in an assortment may occur if the potency of each actor's assortment is increased. Alderson outlines the conditions for the occurrence of exchange between actors A and B as follows:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{quote}
...if X is an element in the assortment A, and Y is an element of the assortment B, then X is exchangeable for Y if, and only if, the following three conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item X is different from Y
  \item The potency of the assortment A is increased by dropping X and adding Y
  \item The potency of the assortment B is increased by adding X and dropping Y
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
\end{footnotesize}

Alderson's term ``potency" is suitable in the abstract--and I will continue its use--though it is worth noting that subsequent work expanded on the original conception by referring to an actor's needs, desires, utility, value and benefits \citep{bagozzi1975, houston1987, kotler1984}. \citet{kotler1984} simply states that each actor must have something that might be of value to the other. Regardless, potency is always treated as something that is uniquely assessed by each actor. And yet, each expects to be better off after an exchange. This is because the item that each actor received is valued more than what they gave up. Mutual gain thus becomes the glue that holds voluntary exchange systems together. \footnote{I should also note that other market contexts have been proposed in which the value one actor possesses cannot be so easily abstracted into an exchangeable ``assortment." These include for instance, the acquisition and use of social or cultural capital \citep{bourdieu1984, veblen1899}. For now, I restrict my theorizing to those resources (i.e. tangible goods or intangilble services) that can be referenced as part of an actor's exchangeable assortment.}

\citet{alderson1965b} further develop Alderson's law of exchange. First, they incorporate the cost of executing an exchange transaction. Second, they allow for each actor to have outside options such that exchange occurs only if both of the actors prefer it to any other alternative. Third, they address the issue of exchange that occurs through a supply chain or distribution channel. 

Other scholars help us further understand the law of exchange by including additional necessary conditions such as the notion that ``...humans are able to anticipate the consequences of their actions", and ``direct their behaviors toward their preferred anticipated consequences" and ``create innovative behaviors that are aimed toward the consequences they desire" \citep[pp. 29-30]{blalock1979}.  Further, \citet {kotler1984} states additional conditions which include: ``each party is capable of communication and delivery" and ``each party believes it is appropriate or desirable to deal with the other party." However, despite these additions, each subsequent treatment of dyadic exchange assumes that actors understand a priori: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The manner in which X differs from Y.
  \item How X or Y can increase the potency of an assortment.
  \item That actor A is not only capable of delivery of X, and B delivery of Y, but that they will deliver. 
\end{enumerate}

Upon which grounds are these knowledge claims based? It may seem a trivial assertion, but the argument as it stands evokes consideration of the neoclassical economic man. Indeed, the troublesome assumption here is that of perfect information--a situation in which actors understand the nature of their own wants and needs, how the element offered by a potential exchange partner can address them, and whether the element will be delivered as promised. Indeed, perfect information is the logical opposite of complete uncertainty. The requirements enumerated above suggest the need for just the sort of uncertainty reducing function that shared representations provide. 

The conditions for exchange posed by \citet{alderson1965a} and those expanding upon his arguments \citep[e.g.][]{blalock1979, kotler1984, houston1987}, are necessary, but insufficient prerequisites to voluntary dyadic exchange. \citet{kotler1984} recognizes that each party must (at a minimum) be capable of communicating their intentions. This partially addresses problems related to ``the manner in which X differs from Y'' and ``how X or Y can increase the potency of an assortment." However, as I will discuss below, the shared representations of actors in an exchange--and in the relevant community of actors--is more primary and a precursor to the sort of communication described by \citet{kotler1984}. \citet{kotler1984} also argues each actor must be capable of delivery, however, enforcement of such behavior is determined by shared social norms \citep{granovetter1985} as defined by for instance, religion, polity or culture \citep{lusch2014}. These institutions are constituted by the relatively persistent set of representations shared by a community of actors \citep{denzau1994}.

\section{The Difference Between X and Y}
\begin{small}
\begin{quote}
``There is not a sentence which adequately states its own meaning. There is always a background of presupposition which defies analysis by reason of its infinitude" \citep[p. 699]{whitehead1951}.
\end{quote}
\end{small}

The conditions for exchange outlined above imply that actors are heterogeneous in the resources they possess and in how they uniquely value elements of the exchange. That X is different from Y (in the Alderson framework) is an artifact of human's ability to notice a difference in the first place. \citet[p. 32]{loasby1999} states, ``...what do economists fail to economise? The answer is the scarce resource of cognition." Our limited cognitive abilities prevent us from processing and storing the vast quantities of information present in our environment \citep{loasby1999, march1958}. In response, individuals construct representations as a way to make sense of the world \citep{denzau1994}. Due to human's limited cognitive ability, these representations necessarily summarize experience \citep{arthur2009, loasby1991, loasby1999, knight1921, whitehead1911, whitehead1951}--that is, they are imperfect and unique. Exactly how X is different from Y depends entirely on the representations each actor maintains. For instance, a toddler can nary tell the difference between a cell phone and a bar of soap. For her, the representations of each object have yet to diverge from the more primitive representation of something rectangular in shape and of a certain weight. 

Given the personal and familiar circumstances surrounding most exchange, it is easy to see how Alderson's logic (that elements of exchange have to be different), can be taken for granted--it is quite natural to think in terms of the difference between for instance, a dollar bill and a chocolate bar. However, recent advances in marketing theory have excoriated these distinctions by exploring the way in which ``indirect exchange masks the fundamental basis of exchange" \citep{vargo2008}. The elements of trade are superficial--they are merely the medium through which an offering is presented. \citet[p. 22]{giddens1991} discusses symbolic tokens, or the ``media of interchange which can be `passed around' without regard to the specific characteristics of individuals or groups that handle them at any particular juncture." A symbolic token dis-embedded from reality doesn't need a reality to be understood \citep{giddens1991, loebler2014}. Symbolic tokens are similar to mediated currencies. ``They refer to something but they do not need the referred object to be exchanged. Money is an example of a symbolic token; it is commonly understood what \$5 ...means" \citep{loebler2014}. As such, money is a placeholder to be further exchanged for objects that increase assortment potency. 

Given our bias as participants in the marketplace, it may be useful to adopt a toy (mental) model that defies common everyday experience but may still be somewhat familiar. Children often like to gather and exchange rocks. For this purpose, let us imagine two child actors ($A_1$ and $A_2$), who each maintain an assortment of rocks. One can then rightly ask, under what conditions will $A_1$ exchange one of her rocks for one or more from $A_2$'s assortment? Given my previous discussion, a necessary precondition is that $A_1$ forms representations of the rocks in her assortment. She could for instance experience that some rocks are larger than others. This experience leads to the formulation of a ``size" representation with certain causal relations like, if I encounter a big rock it is heavier. This representation can then be deployed to categorize and impart meaning on future encounters with rocks, such as those in $A_2$'s assortment. If $A_2$ has developed the same (or similar) representation from his experience, then the condition that X is different from Y is clearly met from the perspective of both actors eyeing each other's assortment.

Alternatively, each actor may develop orthogonal representations of their respective assortment. Whereas $A_1$ develops a representation of ``size," $A_2$ develops a representation of ``shape." In eyeing each other's assortment, the condition that X is different from Y is still met from the perspective of each actor. However, here the condition that ``each party is capable of communication and delivery" \citep[i.e.][p. 8]{kotler1984} becomes problematic. Without shared representation it is impossible to coordinate \citep{shannon1948}. In other words, human representation is the facility with which meaning is applied to a message. With orthogonal representations, there is no basis for coordination. Since I am speaking of voluntary dyadic exchange (what \citet{bagozzi1975} refers to as restricted exchange), then coordination is a necessary condition as \citet{kotler1984} rightly point out. however, the conditions for coordination are rooted in representational homogeny, a subject, which has yet to be explored in the context of exchange.

%\textbf{How can X or Y increase the potency of my assortment?}
Let us continue my example by considering a primitive form of coordination and the shared representations that it requires. Given my two actors and the aforementioned set of orthogonal representations, one could argue that exchange is still possible if an actor were to physically point at the elements of potential trade. $A_1$ need not know of $A_2$'s ``shape" representation to decipher his intent. However, in this modification, I have unintentionally forced another form of representation into my toy mental model--simply, the representation of ``pointing" held by each actor. It is entirely possible and reasonable to assume that actors also have orthogonal representations of pointing behavior, which in turn prevents coordination in the same way as orthogonal representations of element features. To one actor, pointing may represent a sign that indicates this is my most valuable rock and it is not available for exchange. To the other actor, pointing may signal that this is the rock I would like to most rid myself of. Therefore, we never free ourselves from the constraint of shared representation as a precondition for exchange. 

%\textbf{Will they deliver?}
Humans however, are fairly clever at inventing ways to coordinate. As I discussed above, shared representations arise because they are useful. While representations as cognitive structures are internal to the actor, institutions, by definition subsume the representations of an individual \citep{denzau1994}. Thus the act of pointing may become an institution and its meaning tacitly agreed on. In this example, an institution arises as a widespread, long-lived, shared representation, embedded in a community of actors. In the current example, think of pointing perhaps as analogous to a contractual warranty or title. These are essentially institutionalized solutions to handle uncertainty in the delivery of a value proposition. 

While it is not necessary that all representations are shared by both actors in dyadic exchange, it is necessary that some critical proportion are shared. Thus for exchange to occur at all, there needs to be some overlap in representation between two actors (for restricted or dyadic exchange) or some concentration of representation in a community (for exchange in general). Moreover, I argue that the distinction between the elements of exchange (e.g. rocks) and the institutions (e.g. pointing) is non-essential since I can conveniently subsume both under my definition of representation. 

The important intuition is that we recognize the role of shared representations in coordination--one need not understand all features of an element as a prerequisite to making a purchase (economic exchange). It is often the case that just the price tag is sufficient. The behavior of an actor in my example pointing at two rocks is comparable to that which is conveyed by a price tag. The pointing behavior shows one actor's notion of rock equivalence in the same way that a price tag connotes a retailer's notion of equivalence between an object and currency. The pointing process must be interpreted in the same way that a price tag must be interpreted, and each is dependent on the element to which it refers for meaning. This dependency renders the representation of ``pointing" inseparable from the representation of rock in the same way that a representation of price is inseparable from the object to which it refers \citep{erickson1985}. 

The potential increases in potency that motivate an exchange can be conceptualized in a similar manner. That a large rock is suitable as a paperweight is part of its representation and connotes meaning in the same way that the action of pointing or a price tag on an object does. Whether an element has the capacity to increase potency is fully dependent on the representations of the actor in possession of the assortment. However, an understanding of how a recipient intends to value an element can facilitate the exchange of one for another by providing a mode of coordination via the notion of equivalence. Paradoxically, it is the similarity of thought (representation) between two actors that allows for any communication of the manner in which X differs from Y, and thus the way in which a new element might increase potency. The representations shared by two actors form the basis for a definition of how one element differs from another \citep{humphreys2010}. Without a perceptible difference, there can be no conception of value or changes in potency. 

\section{A Shared Representations Model of Exchange\label{ent}}
\begin{small}
\begin{quote}
 ``I would argue...that the concept `redundancy' is at least a partial synonym of `meaning.' As I see it, if the receiver can guess at missing parts of the message, then those parts which are received must, in fact, carry a meaning which refers to the missing parts and is information about those parts" \citep[p. 420]{bateson1972}.
 \end{quote}
 \end{small}
 
\textbf{Market Entropy.}
In my toy model above, actors are in possession of only a small number of representations. For obvious reasons, this is an unrealistic model. Rather, it is likely that actors hold many representations and that some of these representations are the same or similar to those held by other actors. In a more realistic vision of the world, I need some way of describing the similarity of representation in a community of actors. This formalization step is necessary to derive statements about the effect of similarity on various outcomes of interest. For the purposes of this explanatory effort, I can model representational homogeny in terms of the entropy characterizing an exchange system ($I_E$) in which each actor maintains one of a variety of representations about some abstract element of exchange.  
 
My notion of market entropy is defined formally below; however, intuitively it can be viewed as the amount of representational disorder in a community of actors. While technically consistent, the term ``disorder" is a bit of a misnomer in this case. As I use it, ``disorder" is actually equivalent to \emph{increases} in similarity of representation. To illustrate, I turn to an example of entropy used in physics. Imagine a large, clear glass jar filled with water. Then imagine that you insert one drop of red food coloring on one side of the jar and one drop of blue food coloring on the opposite side of the jar. At first, the colors from the red and blue droplets are relatively confined to their respective points of entry. However, given enough time, each droplet diffuses throughout the glass such that all of the water appears purple to an outside observer. 
 
In the above example, the system (of water and food coloring) moved from a state of order (low entropy) to one of disorder (high entropy). That is, the colors were separate and ordered to begin with, but ended up mixed and disordered by the end. If I imagine my community of actors to be the water in this imaginary glass, and each colored droplet to be a representation, then it is easy to see how representational homogeny is actually the result of mixing, and hence, disorder. In the beginning, actors maintain separate (red and blue) representations, but over time these representations are mixed together and shared.
 
I formalize this analogy by relating it to information theory in the following manner. At the beginning of my example, randomly choosing a few water molecules and observing their color gave us reliable information about which side of the glass they were chosen from. However, by the end of my example, observing the color of a few randomly chosen water molecules gave us no information about which side of the glass they were selected from.  I can consider my market $\Omega$, as some relevant population of human actors where $\{A\} = \{A_1, A_2,\ldots,A_n\}$ is an n-cell partition of $\Omega$ and can be interpreted as a grouping of individual actors into meaningful segments. $\{R\} = \{R_1, R_2,\ldots,R_m\}$ is an m-cell partition of $\Omega$, and can be interpreted as a set of distinct representations about some abstract element of exchange.\footnote{This approach is similar to that used by marketing scholars to describe the degree of separation in a set of segmentation pools \citep[see e.g.][]{ramaswamy1993, kamakura1995}. However, here the segmentation variables would constitute some measurement of an actor's representations of the market. See for example, \citet{franke2004} for a contemporary treatment of this issue.}  The information available in this kind of system can be described by,

\begin{equation}
I_E = H(A)+H(R)-H(A \times R)
\end{equation}

$H(A)$ is the uncertainty in the segmentation variable \citep{shannon1948, ramaswamy1993}, 

\begin{equation}
\nonumber H(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n -p_i ln(p_i),
\end{equation}

\noindent where, $p_i$ is the unconditional probability of choosing an $A_i$-type actor at random from the domain population. Similarly, $H(R)$ is the uncertainty in the set of representations held by the community,

\begin{equation}
\nonumber H(R) = \sum_{j=1}^m -p_j ln(p_j),
\end{equation}

\noindent where, $p_j$ is the unconditional probability that a randomly selected actor has representation $R_j$. $H(A \times R)$ is the uncertainty of the system,

\begin{equation}
\nonumber H(A \times R) = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m -p_ip_{ij}ln(p_ip_{ij}),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p_{ij}$ is the conditional probability of $R_j$ given $A_i$ \citep{greeno1970}. It can be shown that $H(A \times R)$ is equal to $H(A) + H(R)$ when the partition variables are independent (i.e. $p_{ij} = p_j$ for all $i$). This means that the information in the system $I_E = 0$ and market entropy is at its maximum. For a population of two, this is equivalent to saying that both actors share the exact same representations (e.g. there is full overlap or full homogeny). In contrast, the case in which all conditional probabilities are either 1 or 0 implies no overlap in representations (no homogeny) between two actors. In this case $I_E$ takes on its maximal value and market entropy is minimized.
 
To illustrate, consider a domain with two actors segmented into types $\{A_1, A_2\}$ and two representations $\{R_1, R_2\}$.  One possible empirical reality is,

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l}
& & $R_1$ & $R_2$ \\
$P(A_i \cap R_j)=$ & $A_1$ & $0.50$ & $0.00$ \\
 & $A_2$ & $0.00$ & $0.50$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Here, 

\begin{equation}
\nonumber H(A) = H(R) = 2(-0.50)ln(0.50) = 0.69,
\end{equation}

\noindent but,

\begin{equation}
\nonumber H(A \times R) = 2[(-0.50)ln(0.50) + (0.00)ln(0.00)].
\end{equation}

Thus, $H(A \times R)$ reduces to $H(A)$ and the value of $I_E$ goes to it's maximum value,

\begin{equation}
\nonumber 0.69 + 0.69 - 0.69 = 0.69.
\end{equation}

In other words, the partition of $\Omega$ by $\{A\}$ gives us the maximum information possible about the differences between each actor with respect to $R$.\footnote{Note that $\lim_{p \to 0}(pln(p)=0)$} An alternative empirical reality is, 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l}
& & $R_1$ & $R_2$ \\
$P(A_i \cap R_j)=$ & $A_1$ & $0.50$ & $0.00$ \\
 & $A_2$ & $0.50$ & $0.00$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In this scenario, $p_{ij}$ clearly equals $p_j$ for all $i$, such that $H(A \times R) = H(A) + H(R)$ and $I_E = 0$. In other words, actors drawn at random from this community maintain $R_1$ and $R_2$ with equal likelihood regardless of which segment they are from. $\{A\}$ provide no insight about $\{R\}$. This result follows from the earlier claim that there will be full overlap in a two-actor framework when my segmentation variables are independent. Clearly, both actors have $R_1$ but not $R_2$.
 
The results expressed in the preceding sections follow from intuition--a maximal entropy value describes situations where actors share completely their representations (the highest level of representational homogeny). Consider again my example of the chair market in North America. If I pick two actors at random, the likelihood that they share a similar representation of chairs is quite high. Information about chairs in this market is diffuse, unordered and high entropy. In contrast, a low level of market entropy ($max(I_E)$) describes minimal sharing (low representational homogeny). If I expand my chair market to include Japan, the likelihood that two actors picked at random from this new population also share a similar representation of chairs is somewhat lower. Information in this new market is more structured, less diffuse and thus lower in market entropy. 
 
Low entropy markets hinder exchange because market actors find it difficult to coordinate. For exchange to occur more readily, some population of actors must adopt (or adapt to) the representations of other market actors. Of course the process through which this occurs can be bi-directional--actors may incorporate parts of one representation and discard others (e.g. the water in the jar turns purple rather than red or blue); however, the important intuition is that under low entropy, some process that encourages similarity (the mixing of ideas) is required in order to drive further exchange.
 
\begin{prop}
An increase in representational homogeny drives exchange when market entropy is low.
\end{prop}

Too much representational homogeny however, may hinder exchange. To illustrate, let us revisit my two-actor model and assume max entropy. This means that representations of value, equivalence and element properties (and all else for that matter) are identical for both actors. What differs, is only the composition of each actor's cache of potential resources. For instance, one actor may have all large rocks and another may have all small rocks. Since both actors share exactly, any representations that contribute to potential potency enhancements, all I need to do is identify one example of potency to understand how the process plays out. For instance, assume that potency is determined by maximizing variance across size. Since each actor has rocks of different sizes, I would expect exchanges to occur until approximately half of each actor's assortment is transferred to the other's assortment. However, at this point in my example, the two-actor system has reached equilibrium and further exchange will not occur (see e.g. \citet{milgrom1982} for how this phenomenon manifests in financial equity markets). In order to prompt further exchange, one needs to impose a different set of representations. For instance, if I exogenously define potency in terms of color variance instead of size variance, my two-actor system will again begin to exchange.
 
\begin{prop}
A decrease in representational homogeny drives exchange when market entropy is high.
\end{prop}

\textbf{Alpha and Beta Markets}.
Based on the preceding arguments and discussion, I can make the claim that all markets have two ``extreme," equilibrium conditions. One equilibrium condition occurs under minimum market entropy; I will label this as an alpha market. The other equilibrium condition occurs when entropy is maximized; I will label this as a beta market. Of course the extreme forms of alpha and beta markets don't exist. However, one can view a market as evolving along a continuum between these extremes--that is, moving on a path toward a min-entropy (alpha) market with high differentiation, toward a max-entropy (beta) market with little differentiation, or fluctuating between the two. When engaging with an alpha market, the major function of marketing is to foster more shared experiences (i.e. similarity). On the other hand, when engaging with a beta market, the major function of marketing is to introduce new representations (i.e. novelty).\footnote{My use of the terms `alpha' and `beta' follow from the finance literature and the standard capital asset pricing model in which the `alpha' coefficient represents the returns in excess of risk born by the investor. Thus `alpha' is used to characterize departures from market norms. In contrast, `beta' is used to refer to performance that adheres to broad market movements (i.e. the status quo).}
 
Novelty however, takes time--it needs to diffuse. Traditionally marketers have characterized this behavior in terms of a product life cycle \citep{gardner1987}. however, I argue that it more accurately be viewed as the epidemiology of a representation \citep{sperber1985}. Recall the droplets of food coloring from my previous example of market entropy. It is not the physical manifestation of a product that is spreading, but rather the mental model (representation) of that product--the market offering. 

A recent example is the introduction of the iPhone. This novel representation changed what had become a high-entropy, undifferentiated (beta) cell phone market, into a low entropy, differentiated (alpha) market. By simply observing a selection of cell phones, one could clearly distinguish which came from Apple and which from another manufacturer. Yet, once this new representation was introduced, market actors (both buyers and sellers) rapidly adopted the novel representation to such an extent that it became the dominant cell phone design. Many firms sought to make their phones ``similar" in appearance and function to an iPhone. The result is what we now call the ``smart phone market," which itself is now returning to a high-entropy, undifferentiated (beta) market. That is, cell phones have again become similar in both appearance and functionality.

\section{Concluding Comments}
From the outset I emphasized that my conceptual framework is intended to help marketing scholars and practitioners envision markets and marketing in a way that is both different and more useful. To accomplish this I took an abstract approach that can be used as a platform for more general theories of marketing. I hope this approach has enabled one to envision markets and marketing as a function of representational homogeny in a community of actors. 

While many in the field have called for more applied, transformative, and managerial research, I suggest that of at least equal importance is the need for more foundational theory. In marketing, I argue that this foundational theory should be built around exchange. The conceptual framework offered herein, can help scholars and practitioners envision markets and marketing as grounded in shared representations between market actors. 
	
I argue that with this type of foundational knowledge of exchange, the discipline can actually be more applied. This is because good theory can provide marketing practitioners and public policy makers with something to apply. I recognize that there are shortcomings to the extended law of exchange, but also see these shortcomings as a call for more research on exchange and exchange systems. Much of this research needs to be at the level of mid-range theory. I begin this process in Chapter \ref{lang} by using research on the legitimation process \citep[e.g.][]{powell2008} to motivate a measure of shared understanding (i.e. representational homogeny) in the biotechnology industry. I then show how this measure is causally related to the trading volume (i.e. exchange) of stocks issued by public firms in that industry.
