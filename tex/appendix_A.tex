\chapter{Robustness: Language Models\label{apndxA}}

\section{Cointegration}

In Chapter \ref{lang} I dropped the first two years of textual data before running the vector error-correction model (VECM). I justified this step because the vocabulary had nearly doubled during these two years as the trade journal ramped up production. However, there is a statistical reason as well. Figure \ref{coint} shows predictions from the cointegrating equation after running the VECM on the full range of data. Note the distinct downward trend in the first few years, which violates a model assumption that the cointegrating equation is stationary around mean zero.

\section{Global Trends}

One alternative explanation for the results in Chapter \ref{lang} is that both the language consistency measure and trading volume are both affected by broader market trends. To account for this possibility, I collected monthly trading volume from the New York Stock Exchange website \footnote{http://www.nyse.com} and include it in the VECM model denoted $LNYSE$. The results are shown in Table \ref{vec2}. As you can see, both the long-term and short-term relationships between language consistency and biotech trading volume still hold. Moreover, there is no cointegrating relationship with $LNYSE$ since the $L.\_ce1$ coefficient is not significant for that variable, nor does $LNYSE$ have any significant short-term effects on either of the other two variables.
