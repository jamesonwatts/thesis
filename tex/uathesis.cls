%%---------------------------- General Renewed Commands----------------
%% 
%% There are several key and subtle LaTeX commands that need to be
%% altered in minor ways from the way they are defined in book.cls.
%% This section 'renew's or redefines them for our use.  In all other
%% sections of this class file, we have strived to use the abstract
%% generic LaTeX commands rather than the more direct (and potentially
%% dangerous) TeX commands.  Since this section renews commands taken
%% from the LaTeX book class file, we follow the (less strict) conventions
%% in that file, so that we are making the minimal changes to these
%% commands to make them work for us.

% We are renewing the following two commands so that there are
% appropriate dot leaders between the TOC item and that TOC item's
% page number.  We replaced the \hfil line with a sequence of commands 
% taken from the latex.ltx file for \@dottedtocline (instead of just
% using \dotfill which gave dots with a slightly different spacing).
% Similarly, we left the page numbers bold, rather than making them
% normalfont.
% 
% The lines that were altered are still present below, but commented out.
% Hopefully this will make it easier to integrate with future versions
% of these commands in LaTeX.
%
% It appears that the formatters no longer want to allow any boldfacing
% in TOC-related items, so \bfseries items have been commented out 
% below.
%
% Otherwise these two commands are identical to those in the 
% 2001/04/21 v1.4e book.cls.

% The following two commands were renewed so that these items don't 
% have a larger font size than everything else.  Not required, but it
% makes things fit in since the chapter title can't be big.
%
% A note on bold sections: The default below is how Grad College wants
% it.  This way sections are in the same font and face as they appear
% in the TOC (we could have done it the other way around and made the
% sections in the TOC bold, but then every entry in the TOC would be
% boldface, and that would look dumb, too).  This class file forces
% compliant behavior.  However, I think that it significantly improves
% the readability of the document if the section titles within the
% text are in boldface.  So in the following two commands, you'll see
% a commented out line that says "<-- makes section bold".  Uncomment
% that, and comment out the line below it to get boldface sections,
% if you want.
% 
% Otherwise this command is identical to the \section and \subsection
% newcommands in the 2001/04/21 v1.4e book.cls.
\renewcommand{\section}{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}%
							{-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%

% The following four commands were renewed so that text in the body
